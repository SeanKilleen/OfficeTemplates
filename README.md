# OfficeTemplates
A collection of office templates that I find useful in my day-to-day life and work. I'll eventually be documenting these here and [on the blog](http://SeanKilleen.com)

# How to Use

* Clone this repository
* Open any of the office file templates
* A new document will be created for you to use.

You can also click `Download ZIP` on the bottom right-hand side to get these templates all in one zip file.

# Improvements welcome! 
Have a suggestion? Find an issue? I'd love to hear about it. Contact me at <SeanKilleen@gmail.com> to notify me, or [create an issue here](https://github.com/SeanKilleen/OfficeTemplates/issues/new). 

Even better -- if you fix the issue in the template, you can contribute it back to the repository and I'd be happy to give you some credit. Let me know if you have any difficulty.
